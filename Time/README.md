# Tips about Time class
I used '%02d' in line 15 of Time.java,
it's used to set the width of int in that string and fill that width with zero<br />,
2 means width of integer will be 2 (even if it has one digit), and the 0 behind that 2 means to fill that space with zero, and 'd' means integer value<br />,
ex: '9' will convert to '09' in final string<br />
