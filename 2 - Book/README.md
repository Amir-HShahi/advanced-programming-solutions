# Tips about Book class
## toString() method
it's a method to return an object as String<br />
as you can see it has @override annotation, it means all the object have this method,<br />
and we are implementing that method again, so it will return what we want, not the default one<br />
## better know this:
print() method automatically calls toString method<br />
we can pass book object as parameter like this: <br />
System.out.println(book);
